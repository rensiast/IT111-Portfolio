# IT111-Portfolio

Finals Project for my IT111 course.

# About the Project

In this project, I leveraged HTML to structure the content of my portfolio, emphasizing
semantic elements for improved accessibility and search engine optimization. CSS is used to style
and enhance the visual presentation of web pages, ensuring a professional and polished look. The Sustainable Development Goal established by the United Nations featured in this project is the SDG 3: Good Health and Well Being.
